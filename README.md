# CompanyCFM - ContrackFM Technical Assessment

## Project Overview

This project is part of a technical assessment for ContrackFM. It involves building an **ASP.NET Core Web API** to showcase technical skills.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **SQL Server**

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaarkNassef/CompanyCFM.git
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:
   - Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
   - Navigate to the file [`CompanyCFM\SqlQueries\SQLQueriesForDBCreation.sql`](https://github.com/MaarkNassef/CompanyCFM/blob/master/CompanyCFM/SqlQueries/SQLQueriesForDBCreation.sql).
   - Execute the SQL queries to create the necessary database and tables.

<!-- Already included in packages
3. **Configure Entity Framework Core**:
   Install the following NuGet packages:
   - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`
   - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`
   - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`
   - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`

   You can install these packages via the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or using the command line:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
   ```
-->

3. **Update the database connection string**:
   Ensure the connection string in `appsettings.json` is correctly pointing to your local or remote SQL Server instance.

4. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

You can interact with the API using the following methods:

- **Postman**: Use Postman to send HTTP requests and test the API endpoints.
- **Browser**: Open your browser and navigate to the Swagger UI, which is automatically generated for the project. It allows you to explore and test the API endpoints in a user-friendly interface.

Swagger UI is typically accessible at:
```
http://localhost:<port>/swagger
```
